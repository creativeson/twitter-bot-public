my twitter bot
https://bit.ly/3QAzL1M
This Twitter bot can execute two tasks by using threading.
1. Reply to an account that replies to my tweet with a certain keyword.
2. Perform an ETL process that can retrieve earthquake data from a central weather API. Transform the data to get the right information I want to share. Tweet the new earthquake information and load it into a cloud database (MongDB).
